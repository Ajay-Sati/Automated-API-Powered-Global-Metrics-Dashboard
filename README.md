# Automated-API-Powered-Global-Metrics-Dashboard

#### Overview

This project builds a real-time dashboard by integrating data from the World Data API. Using Python, the pipeline automatically fetches, cleans, and transforms global indicators such as health, education, poverty, trade, environment, and economic metrics. The processed data is then connected directly to Power BI, enabling automatic refresh without manual updates.

#### What the Project Delivers

- Automated API data extraction using Python
- Cleaned and transformed datasets ready for analysis
- Live connection to Power BI for real-time dashboard refresh
- Visual insights on global socio-economic and health indicators
- Analysis answering key questions on trends, correlations, regional patterns, poverty reduction, and development performance

#### Tools & Technologies

- Python (Requests, Pandas, NumPy)
- World Data API
- Power BI Desktop
- Jupyter Notebook
